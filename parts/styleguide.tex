\section{Style Guide}

This section gives advice how code is to be written in the standard library.
It shall be used as a guide to readable Tyr code.

\subsection{Orderings}

\paragraph{Order of Inheritance}
The order of inheritance should be type/class, interfaces, properties.


\subsection{Naming}

All names are CamelCase.

\paragraph{Capitalization}

Namespaces, variables, parameters, fields, functions, properties and parameterless types start with small letters.
Acronyms, classes, interfaces, type variables and parameterized types start with a capital letter.

\subparagraph{Rationale}
Capitalization of types should be consequent and and intuitive.
Hence, the convention tries to mimic the Java conventions.
The lack of predefined types requires different treatment of parameterized and unparameterized types.

\subsection{Whitespaces}
Never use tab characters in source code.
Clarifies where to use how much spaces.

\paragraph{Indentation}
Indentation uses two spaces.

\paragraph{Operators}
Use one space before and after a binary operator.
A part of a literal is not an operator, e.g. \verb+(-1)+, \verb+(!true)+ or \verb+!(x == y)+

\paragraph{Brackets}
Brackets do not require space before or after them.
Brackets and keywords count as space, e.g.
